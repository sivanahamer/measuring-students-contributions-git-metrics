## Abstract

Many courses in the software engineering area are centered  around team-based project development. Evaluating these  projects is a challenge due to the difficulty of measuring individual student contributions versus team contributions.  The adoption of distributed version control systems like Git  enables the measurement of students’ and teams’ contributions  to the project. In this work, we analyze the contributions  within five software development projects from undergraduate courses that used project-based learning. For this, we generate visualizations of aggregated Git metrics using  inequality  indexes and inter-decile ratios, which offer insights into the practices and processes followed by students and teams throughout the project development. This approach allowed us to identify both inequality among students’ contributions and  development processes with a non-steady pace, rendering a useful feedback tool for instructors and students during the  development of the project. Further  studies can be conducted to assess the complexity and value of students’ contributions by analyzing their source code commits and other software  artifacts.
